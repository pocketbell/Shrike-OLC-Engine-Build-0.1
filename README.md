Learning C++ and building systems.
This project is built using the OLC Game Engine.
//OLC Engine provides display to screen, input from keyboard and mouse tracking, as well as updating all drawing on a timer.



//Systems "Complete":

//Draw Rect to 2D Array.
 
//Print to screen based on location in a "SCREEN" 2D Array.
 
//Print cut out to seperate screen area to display WORLD Array inside SCREEN Array.
 
//Camera movement "Shift world Array inside Screen Array by a Global Offset".
 
//Player Rect, Movement, and Collision, (Collision used to check the value at a array location based on Rect Origin plus Height and Width).
 
//Basic Color Picker.

//Limited array refreshing.
